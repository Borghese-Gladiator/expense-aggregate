# Expense Aggregation
Python ETL pipeline to build full transaction history from multiple credit cards

Currently, it is only one Pandas script that aggregates CSVs though

## Usage Instructions
- download transaction history
  - rename statements to include company name (can use `Powershell` script potentially)
    - if company not present in "company enum", write company parse logic in "find_transactions_table" and "normalize_transaction_df"
- update script "CONSTANTS"
- run locally
  ```
  poetry install
  poetry shell
  python main.py
  ```

## Notes
Bootstrap Steps
- `poetry init`
- `git init`
- write `.gitignore` using online `Python.gitignore`
- `poetry add loguru tabula-py[jpype] pandas`
  - NOTE: `tabula` is a package, but not related to reading PDFs
- write main.py
- download `financial_transaction_history` from all my credit card companies
- > write methodology
- [X] download PDFs
- [X] extract tables from PDFs to build transactions list CSV => gave up
- [X] download all as CSVs
- [X] build aggregated table
  - [X] add default column of rent_applicable_transaction
- [X] create Excel spreadsheet
- [ ] build subset Excel spreadsheet by filter on rent_applicable_transaction column


### PDF Extraction Libraries
- pypdf
  - extract text and manually filter using index per type of PDF instead
  - Pros - very easy for library since I simply run `page.extract_text().split('\n')`
  - Cons
    - certain text gets appended together with no delimeter (eg: `Dec 11 Dec 11 MASALA BAYLITTLETONMA $116.37 `)
    - tons of custom code
      - pick page number
      - pick start of transaction list string
      - pick end of transaction list string
      - write logic to parse out each string
  - (possible implementation: Check row content to determine when to stop)
- camelot
  - NOTE: `poetry add camelot-py[base]` (NOT `camelot`)
  - camelot-py installation
    - use Python 3.8 - depends on `pdftopng 0.2.3` which requires Python 3.8, 3.7, or 3.6.
    - `poetry add opencv-python`
    - download [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html)
      - check installed with either command:
        - `gswin64c --version`
        - ```python
          import ctypes
          from ctypes.util import find_library
          find_library("".join(("gsdll", str(ctypes.sizeof(ctypes.c_voidp) * 8), ".dll")))
          ```
    - `poetry add ghostscript`
  - CLI usage
    - `camelot lattice -plot text .\capital_one_Smry_2023_1496.pdf`
      - `poetry add matplotlib` - `ImportError: matplotlib is required for plotting.`
  - NOTE: Did not find any text and could not figure out how to customize
- tabula
  - NOTE: `poetry add tabula-py`
  - > WARNING: The stream doesn't provide any stream length, using fallback readUntilEnd, at offset 64514
  - This warning indicates that the library is unable to determine the length of the PDF stream, so it falls back to a method called readUntilEnd.
  - Tabula works for basic tables, but my financial documents require customization. Tabula customizes via template which are generated by the desktop app.
    - the Tabula desktop app requires installation of ORACLE Java 8. Using OpenJDK 8 (Zulu) does not seem to work. Oracle Java 8 does not ship with an installer and requires manual config (JAVA_HOME I assume?). Either way, I elected against spending more effort on Java 8 which I would need to uninstall manually

#### PDF Methodology

Method A
- download PDFs
- extract tables from PDFs to build transactions list CSV
- build Excel spreadsheet from aggregated table
  - add default column of rent_applicable_transaction
- build subset Excel spreadsheet of rent applicable transactions using column

Method B
- download PDFs
- extract tables from PDFs to build transactions list CSV
- build Next.js webapp
	- display list of transactions in Material Table (filter + sort columns)
	- display list of J Shee transactions via hard-coded code
	- deploy to Vercel

# To DO
- write ETL pipeline to get near real-time data
  - write Extract script to download transaction info
    - integrate w/ banks
  - update Transform script to run on transaction info
  - write Load script to save transaction info
    - build Google Sheets w/ pivot tables + graphs like "Timmy Expense Tracker"
- investigate using cron for ETL pipeline
